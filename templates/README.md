Our curriculum is designed with two key pedagogical principles in mind: project-based learning and frequent quizzes. The program teaches the fundamentals of the Power Platform as the latest tools and techniques used by today's creators. Students will have the opportunity to develop hands-on experience by building [...]. By the end of the series, students will have gained a solid understanding of Power Platform capabilities.
