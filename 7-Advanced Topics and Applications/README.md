### Why are code first methods used in Power Platform solutions

The Power Platform contains several low-code methods for applying business logic for example Power Fx formulas and business rules. These are declarative methods that applies the logic that you define. However, these declarative methods have limitations such as the complexity of the logic that these methods support.

[Fusion Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/fusion-development) is the idea that citizen developers, professional developers, and IT professionals are able to work together to create business solutions by using both low-code and code-first methods.

Developers build components that makers and IT professionals  use just like other components provided the  Microsoft Power Platform.

### Code options (JS)

There are many ways in which Power Platform developers extend the logic and processing in a Power Platform solution:

- **Plug-ins**: .NET assemblies that are run at various stages in the execution pipeline when a row is saved to a Dataverse table.
- **Custom Workflow assemblies**: .NET assemblies that are added to Dataverse classic workflows to extend the capabilities of workflow steps.
- **Custom APIs**: New messages for the Web API.
- **Client script**: JavaScript that runs in a model-driven app form to change the form's behavior at runtime.
- **Code components (PCF)**: User interface controls created with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS that can be added to canvas apps, model-driven apps, and Power Pages sites.
